# Exploratory HTTP Client

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory HTTP client implemented in TypeScript. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into building a rudimentary HTTP client that can perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The client is designed to interact with a simple HTTP server and handle JSON responses.

## Features

- **GET Request**: This HTTP client can perform GET requests to retrieve data from the server.

- **POST Request**: It can be used to send POST requests with JSON payloads to create new resources on the server.

- **PUT Request**: It HTTP client supports PUT requests to update existing resources on the server.

- **DELETE Request**: You can use the client to send DELETE requests to remove resources from the server.

## Limitations

While the exploratory HTTP client provides basic functionalities for making HTTP requests, it comes with several limitations:

- **Simplified Functionality**: The client is intentionally kept minimal to focus on the fundamentals of building an HTTP client. It lacks many features commonly found in full-fledged HTTP clients, such as interceptors, request retries, and caching.

- **Error Handling**: The error handling mechanism is basic and might not cover all possible error scenarios. For production-ready applications, more robust error handling is necessary.

- **Security Considerations**: The client does not implement security measures like HTTPS. In real-world applications, using HTTPS is crucial to ensure data privacy and security.

- **No Configuration Options**: The client does not support configuration options like timeout settings, custom headers, or authentication mechanisms. These features are typically essential in production-ready HTTP clients.

## Getting Started

To use this exploratory HTTP client, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
Explore and experiment with the HttpClient class in the src/HttpClient.ts file. You can use the provided example usage in the same file as a starting point.

To run the sample usage code, use the following command:

```sh
ts-node filename.ts
```
Observe the output in the console to see the results of the sample GET and POST requests.

## Usage

```ts
import HttpClient from "./src/HttpClient";

// Initialize the HTTP client
const client = new HttpClient("https://example.com");

interface Todo {
  todoId: number;
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

// Make a GET request
async function getTodos() {
  try {
    const response = await client.get<Todo>("/todos/1");
    console.log("Response Data:", response.data);
    console.log("Status Code:", response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

getTodos();

// Make a POST request
const newTodo: Todo = {
  todoId: 1,
  id: 1,
  title: "Sample Todo",
  completed: false,
};

try {
  const response = await client.post<Todo>("/todos", { body: newTodo });
  console.log("Created Todo:", response.data);
  console.log("Status Code:", response.status);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

## Future Improvements

 - [x] HTTPS Support: Provide HTTPS support to the HTTP client to make secure connections.

 - [ ] Timeout: Implement a timeout feature to handle request timeouts.

 - [ ] Response Type: Allow specifying the expected response type for better type checking.

 - [ ] onProgress: Implement progress tracking for long-running requests.

 - [ ] Interceptor: Add support for request/response interceptors to modify requests or responses.

 - [ ] Error Handling: Enhance error handling with more detailed error messages.
