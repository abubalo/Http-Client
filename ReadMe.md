# Exploratory HTTP Client

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory HTTP client implemented in TypeScript. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into building a rudimentary HTTP client that can perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The client is designed to interact with a simple HTTP server and handle JSON responses.

## Features

- **GET Request**: This HTTP client can perform GET requests to retrieve data from the server.

- **POST Request**: It can be used to send POST requests with JSON payloads to create new resources on the server.

- **PUT Request**: It HTTP client supports PUT requests to update existing resources on the server.

- **DELETE Request**: You can use the client to send DELETE requests to remove resources from the server.

## Limitations

While the exploratory HTTP client provides basic functionalities for making HTTP requests, it comes with several limitations:

- **Simplified Functionality**: The client is intentionally kept minimal to focus on the fundamentals of building an HTTP client. It lacks many features commonly found in full-fledged HTTP clients, such as interceptors, request retries, and caching.

- **Error Handling**: The error handling mechanism is basic and might not cover all possible error scenarios. For production-ready applications, more robust error handling is necessary.

- **Security Considerations**: The client does not implement security measures like HTTPS. In real-world applications, using HTTPS is crucial to ensure data privacy and security.

- **No Configuration Options**: The client does not support configuration options like timeout settings, custom headers, or authentication mechanisms. These features are typically essential in production-ready HTTP clients.

## Getting Started

To use this exploratory HTTP client, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   Explore and experiment with the HttpClient class in the src/HttpClient.ts file. You can use the provided example usage in the same file as a starting point.
   ```

To run the sample usage code, use the following command:

```sh
ts-node filename.ts
```

Observe the output in the console to see the results of the sample GET and POST requests.

## Usage

To use the `HttpClient` class, follow these examples for making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests along with error handling.

### Initialize the HTTP Client

```typescript
import HttpClient from "./src/HttpClient";

// Initialize the HTTP client with the base URL
const client = new HttpClient("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");
```

Make a `GET` Request.

```ts
interface Todo {
  userId: number;
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

async function getTodos() {
  try {
    const response = await client.get<Todo>("/todos/1");
    console.log("GET Request Response Data:", response.data);
    console.log("GET Request Status Code:", response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("GET Request Error:", error);
  }
}

getTodos();
```

Make a `POST` Request

```ts
const newTodo: Todo = {
  userId: 1,
  id: 1,
  title: "Sample Todo",
  completed: false,
};

async function createTodo() {
  try {
    const response = await client.post<Todo>("/todos", { body: newTodo });
    console.log("POST Request Response Data:", response.data);
    console.log("POST Request Status Code:", response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("POST Request Error:", error);
  }
}

createTodo();
```

Make a `PUT` Request

```ts
const updatedTodo: Todo = {
  userId: 1,
  id: 1,
  title: "Updated Todo",
  completed: true,
};

async function updateTodo() {
  try {
    const response = await client.put<Todo>("/todos/1", { body: updatedTodo });
    console.log("PUT Request Response Data:", response.data);
    console.log("PUT Request Status Code:", response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("PUT Request Error:", error);
  }
}

updateTodo();
```

Make a `PATCH` Request

```ts
// Define the updated data for the PATCH request
const updatedData: Partial<Todo> = {
  title: "Updated Title",
};

async function patchData() {
  try {
    const response = await client.patch<Todo>("/todos/1", {
      body: updatedData,
    });
    console.log("PATCH Request Response Data:", response.data);
    console.log("PATCH Request Status Code:", response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("PATCH Request Error:", error);
  }
}

patchData();
```

Make a `DELETE` Request

```ts
async function deleteTodo() {
  try {
    const response = await client.delete<Todo>("/todos/1");
    console.log("DELETE Request Response Data:", response.data);
    console.log("DELETE Request Status Code:", response.status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("DELETE Request Error:", error);
  }
}

deleteTodo();
```

## Future Improvements

- [x] HTTPS Support: Provide HTTPS support to the HTTP client to make secure connections.

- [x] PATCH method Support: Provide support to the HTTP client to make a PATCH request.

- [ ] Timeout: Implement a timeout feature to handle request timeouts.

- [ ] Response Type: Allow specifying the expected response type for better type checking.

- [ ] onProgress: Implement progress tracking for long-running requests.

- [ ] Interceptor: Add support for request/response interceptors to modify requests or responses.

- [x] Error Handling: Enhance error handling with more detailed error messages.
